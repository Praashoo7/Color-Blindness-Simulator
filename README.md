P.S : I am aware that chrome already provides these filters in it! I just created this as a side project. Also Chrome includes filters for 4 main types of Color Blindnesses but here i have tried to include all 7 of them. Some filters are from chrome itself and others are from hail2u. The other types are not drastically different from the main 3 types but i just added them in case anyone needs them!
